How to compile using cmake
==========================

CMake is a tool that generates build files for a variety of platforms. It uses the configuration file CMakeLists.txt.

Linux
=====

Create a directory where you want cmake to put all his temporary files. (I usually call mine build/) Go there and invoke the cmake command with the path to the CMakeLists.txt file :

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

This will generate a default Unix Makefile. You can then build:

make

If you want to customize the build, use ccmake instead of cmake:

ccmake ..

It will open a ncurse interface where you can change various parameters. Press 'c' to initialize them to the default values. Change them as desired, and hit 'g'. It will generate customized Makefiles.

Note that executable will fail if they are not run from the directory containing images/ and pixmaps/

Windows
=======

You will need the SDL development libraries installed on your computer.

There are several possibilities. I am using cmake-gui.

- Fill the "source code" field with the path to the root directory of curseofwar
- Fill the "binairies" field with the path of your build directory
- Press "Configure"
- If your SDL install is at a custom location, you will need to fill the appropriate fields and hit "configure" again.
- Under windows, you will need to uncheck "CW_NCURSE_FRONTEND" and "CW_SDL_MULTIPLAYER"
- Press "Generate"
- A project file was created in the build directory. Use it to build the projects.

Note that executable will fail if they are not run from the directory containing images/ and pixmaps/
